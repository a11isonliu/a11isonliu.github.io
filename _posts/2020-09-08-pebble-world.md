Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I helped developed a new bouldering area with some friends. This is a video I made of one of the most exciting and fun climbs we discovered called "Thy Holy Arete".

During the Summer of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down much of the world. Luckily, in Boulder, CO, I still had plenty of access to the outdoors and so many rocks to climb. I was dealing with an ankle injury for much of the time, so I couldn't climb, but I had the opportunity to go exploring in the Flatirons and help develop a new bouldering area with some friends.
