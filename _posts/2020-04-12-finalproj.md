While I was trying to find more inspiration for this project, I thought about the reasons why I was interested in taking this class and feeling grateful for the opportunities that I have had in college. These past few days in quarantine, I have spent a fair amount of time thinking about why I am doing what I am doing and about the activities that I truly enjoy doing, specifically academically. One of my goals with this class was to be able to blend my interests in geometric objects and their mathematical properties with the physical world. I have really enjoyed what I have been creating so far, but I realized that I hadn't created anything inspired by my academic interests yet.

I began researching how to create mathematical functions and parametric surfaces in Rhino, and that's where the new idea for this project began. Through doing this, I realized and learned it was pretty simple to create new commands in Rhino using Python. This, I figured, was a great way to combine skills I already have with the skills I have learned in this class throughout the semester. Along the way, I have discovered that combining coding with a powerful modeling program that I personally find really useful is something I really enjoy, and would definitely consider as a career.

I found the Rhino Developer Docs page [Rhino.Python](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/) to be a really helpful and invaluable resource.

I didn't just want to generate objects by hand, since I wanted to hand-model at least part of the project, so I decided to model the Turing Machine, or 'Bombe'. It was a machine created by Alan Turing that broke the German Enigma code during WWII, and helped the Allies defeat Germany. I've been inspired by this machine since I was in high school. As Alan Turing is considered the father of computer science, I thought it was fitting symbolism for this project.

For the computer generated portion, I set up a still life on a table. The hyperbolic paraboloid on the left of the table was created using Mathematica. The other two objects were created using functions found on the tutorial page on the Rhino Developer site. Both functions take user-inputs and then create an object based on those user inputs. In addition to generating models, I also created helpful functions, like locking and unlocking all curves and renaming objects. The object that appears to be hanging in free-space was actually created by accident while I was trying to re-create a tree-drawing function. I thought the object was reminiscent of the Bohr Model of the atom and also a reminder that a lot of cool discoveries are made unintentionally, so I decided to include it. I imagined it could be made out of copper wire or something similar and hanging from the ceiling if this model were made in real life.

I wanted the whole room to be reminiscent of a laboratory or research-type setting; a place which inspires people to ask unique questions about the world and a space which holds the answers to those questions. Naturally, this means slightly chaotic. I found myself missing my own research lab (the place and the people).

The rendering of this project was done in Rhino. I downloaded Fusion360 intending to use it, but it crashed my computer twice when I tried to import my Rhino file, so I gave up and just used Rhino. I couldn't really get all the textures and exact colors that I wanted, but I am ok with it. I don't think I'm that enthusiastic about rendering, but definitely understand why it is useful to know how to do.

**Final Thoughts**

When I made my first blog post for this class, I stated that this class was going to be exactly what I thought it would be and wanted it to be. It was. The modeling and fabrication skills I have learned, combined with the artistic component of the class, made it one of the best and most fun classes I have ever taken. Personally, I know I'll use Rhino and the modeling skills I have learned in the future in my career and as a creative outlet as well. I'm pretty thrilled for all that I have created and learned in this class.

### In Progress 4/29/20:

Everything is mostly modeled for presenting to the class. I cleaned up lots of components on the Turing Machine, like the wires, and added gears on the top left and on the back.

### Progress 4/28/20:

I have decided to switch projects and work on something more math/computer science related. I'm feeling much more motivated and excited to pursue this project. It's pretty late to be switching projects, but I think it will be worth it and a project I am much more invested in. Since quarantine started, I haven't been thrilled, because I really wanted to be able to fabricate for this class. Combining my final project with something computer-science and math related will be useful in the future for me, even if I don't fabricate my model(s) in the future.

### Progress 4/22/20:

I'm not that thrilled with how this piece is turning out so far, so I am a bit disappointed. Part of me wants to change projects.

### Sketches 4/12/20:

My idea for this project was inspired by my love of rock climbing I've always found myself in awe of the great landscapes and freedom that the sport has brought me to. I plan to model a map with locations of climbing spots and large rocks/landscapes that have inspired me from across the United States.
