A collection of Applied Math projects I have done throughout my undergraduate career at CU Boulder. These collaborative projects vary in topic and complexity. (Ex: Foraging Patterns in Ants, Modeling Disease Epidemics with Markov Chains)<!--more-->

## Mathematical Modeling
#### Foraging Patterns in Ants
A study of swarm intelligence, done for Chaos in Dynamical Systems at CU Boulder, Fall 2021

#### Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2021
This was a project done in 100hrs for the international Mathematical Contest in Modeling. The goal of the data insight problem was to classify citizen reports of invasive Asian giant hornet sightings in Washington state, to help determine which reports were most plausible. Our group achieved an Honorable Mention designation. The problem we solved was Problem C, a data insight problem.

## Fourier Analysis
#### Propagation of voltage in a neuron: the cable equation
We derive, solve, and analyze the cable equation to model how action potentials propagate from a neuron's main body (soma) down an axon.

## Differential Equations and Linear Algebra
#### The Hill Cipher
The goal of this project was to study the Hill cipher, a linear algebra based encryption method invented in 1929, and its applications. Fall 2019.
