This is a collection of algorithms programmed in an Artificial Intelligence class. While relatively simple, these algorithms form the foundations of many more sophisticated techniques for optimization. Included traversal algorithms are Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A star. The algorithms are demonstrated on a weighted undirected graph of connected cities, as well as a maze that is represented as a matrix of binary values.
