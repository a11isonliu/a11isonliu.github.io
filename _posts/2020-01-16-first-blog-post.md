After the first day of class, I think this class will be exactly what I expected it to be. I am excited to learn fabrication skills and think it will be really useful in the future. The class is different than most of my engineering classes in that I will get many opportunities to create and get feedback. I like the aspect of this class that connects with math. 

Although I had a lot of questions, using Rhino felt very intuitive and much more intuitive to use than other programs that I have tried to use, like Solidworks. It was pretty similar to Photoshop and Illustrator. The coordinate system and the command line made Rhino easier to use than other programs; I thought they made the program much easier to use. I am looking forward to learning how to use Rhino more effectively and efficiently this semester.
