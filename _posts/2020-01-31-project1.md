Overall, I really enjoyed doing this project. The theme of the project was about using positive and negative space, and for me, thoughts of the positive and negative spaces we can find ourselves in as people were brought to mind. I decided to create a commemorative piece of my teammate Alana Chen who committed suicide in December 2019. I chose wood as my medium, because I wanted the piece to have a more timeless, elegant, and warm feeling. In the piece, our old team logo was cut out using a laser cutter and I engraved an "In memory of" statement. Alana was cut out and elevated, because I wanted attention to be drawn to her. When displaying the piece, I intentionally raised the picture to above eye-level to make it seem as if we were looking up at her.

Progress and Settings:
First try done on with a size of 5x7. I hadn't fixed the contrast of the picture yet.

Settings used:
These are the settings used for cutting through the 1/8" piece of birchwood that I was using. For rastering, I used settings of 50% speed, 50% power and a frequency of 50. For vector engraving, I used the same settings as below, except for a speed of 60%.

In progress:
This is an image of the project in the laser cutter. It took 48 minutes to raster.
