This layering project piece was inspired by the 728-ton tuned mass damper at the top of the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan. I had seen this ball that kept the Taipei 101 standing through earthquakes as a kid and it is something that has always been really memorable for me. The black ball resembling the damper was cut out of two-inch thick insulation foam using a CNC Router and the frame was put together by hand using 2x4 pieces of wood. The ball in the project is hanging and swinging much like it does in the Taipei 101 building and the frame remains open for people to interact with, much like in the building itself. While hanging, the ball spins and is a bit unbalanced, because the top half of the ball is made using three pyramids that are all slightly offset and the string is hung through the center of one of the pyramids. 

Overall, I was not super happy with this piece. It felt a little plain and I was never super excited about it while I was building and designing it. The piece lost a lot of detail while the CNC was cutting and I was disappointed by that. I think for next time, I will use a smaller drill bit and try to keep the details of the piece more significant. I was able to regain some of my edges from sanding though, which was actually very fun to do. In the end, I was more pleased with it than I expected and I liked the slightly off-balanced, handmade look to it. I also liked that it had moving parts.

An image of the final model that was sent to the CNC. A lot of detail was lost in the cutting process.
