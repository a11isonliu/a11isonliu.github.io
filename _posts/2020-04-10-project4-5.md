My final piece for the mold-making project was an anatomical heart. I definitely feel like this was the most complicated modeling piece I have ever created. I intended to 3d print the heart and then create a pour mold out of silicone with it. Then, I would have cast it out of resin. The heart was modeled to be about 3 inches tall and 2 inches wide.

For the joinery project, I decided to make a cage around the heart, which would have been CNC'ed and partially laser cut out of birchwood planks.

Final Piece:
