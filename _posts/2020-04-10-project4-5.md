My final piece for the mold-making project was an anatomical heart. I definitely feel like this was the most complicated modeling piece I have ever created. I intended to 3d print the heart and then create a pour mold out of silicone with it. Then, I would have cast it out of resin. The heart was modeled to be about 1.8x1.8x3 inches at its maximum height and width.

For the joinery project, I decided to make a cage around the heart, which would have been partially CNC'ed and partially laser cut out of birchwood planks. The joint included in my project is a cross miter joint with a jigsaw key and can be cut using a 1/4" bit on the CNC. The pieces for the joint and the base of the cage would have been 1/4" thick birchwood and CNC'ed and the pieces making up the cage would have been laser cut out of 1/8' thick birchwood. The cage wound up being 4.5x4.5x5.6 inches.

Test Joint:

Overall, I wanted this piece to have a sort of fantastical, Beauty and the Beast, type-feel to it, with the sort of fairytale symbolism of a heart floating on display in a cage. I would have hung the heart from the top of the cage using fishing line or something similar so there would be a small element of motion to the piece. I liked the idea of pairing a realistic object with a more animated idea. I've always been fascinated with the human heart since high school biology and was excited to try and get to model it.
