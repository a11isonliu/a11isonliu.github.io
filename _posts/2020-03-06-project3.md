This piece was inspired by time spent in the moutains. My favorite animals to see in the wild are black bear, who are so powerful, but also so scared and timid. I wanted my piece to embody the spirit of the black bear and have the same powerful presence and I thought cardboard would be the perfect medium to accomplish this. I also wanted to do something a little bit more technical unfolding-wise, because I love doing modular origami.  

I didn't really like how the head fit onto the neck, but it does add a little bit of movement to the bear's head and it is a natural breaking point on the bear's body. If I were to do this again, I might try and make the model in rhino fit the head a little bit better. Originally, when I was modeling, the head didn't show enough detail when I unrolled it at the same level of detail as the body. Ultimately, I really enjoyed doing this project and thought it turned out really well. One day, I would love to make this bear life-sized! The final piece was 11.85" tall x 17.37" long x 9.17" wide.
