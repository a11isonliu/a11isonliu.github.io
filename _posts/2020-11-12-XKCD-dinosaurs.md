In this post, I find the solution to a problem found in an XKCD comic involving raptors attacking a human. The goal was to find the optimal action for a human who is surrounded by three raptors positioned in an equilateral triangle. The problem appears in an XKCD comic at <https://xkcd.com/135/>.

## Question 2
Let the human position be $\boldsymbol{h}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and a raptor's position $\boldsymbol{r}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

A raptor's motion can be modeled as

$$\frac{d \boldsymbol{r}}{dt} = v_r \frac{\boldsymbol{h}(t)-\boldsymbol{r}(t)}{|\boldsymbol{h}(t)-\boldsymbol{r}(t)|}  \text{     }  (Eq. 1)$$

where if $\boldsymbol{x}=(x,y)$ then we define $\vert \boldsymbol{x}\vert = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.

The three raptor's each satisfy this ODE separately, but the $x$ and $y$ components of a raptor's motion are coupled, so we have 2-dimensional ODEs.

For simplicity, we assume the human runs in a constant direction and at a constant speed. Thus,

$$\boldsymbol{h}(t) = v_ht\frac{\boldsymbol{c}}{| \boldsymbol{c}|}+ \boldsymbol{h}(0) \text{     } (Eq. 2)$$

where $\boldsymbol{c} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is an initial direction and $\boldsymbol{h}(0)$ is the human's initial position.

We substitute $\boldsymbol{h}(t)$ into equation (1) to obtain $\frac{d \boldsymbol{r}}{dt}=F(t, \boldsymbol{r})$ for some function F (to be defined).

As in the comic, the human is at the center of an equilateral triangle with 20m sidelengths. The human has a top speed of $v_h=6$ m/s. The healthy raptors have a top speed of $v_r=25$ m/s. We'll assume the injured raptor can run at 20 m/s to make the problem more interesting.

Define the human as "caught" when the raptor is within 0.01 m of the human. Specifically, assume the human starts running at a $56^{\circ}$ angle above the horizontal.

We have $\boldsymbol{h}(0)=(0,0)$ since the human starts at the origin. $v_h=6$, the (max) velocity of the human.

To determine $\boldsymbol{c}$ we have $y=6\sin(56)\approx 4.974$ and $x=6 \cos(56) \approx 3.355$. 

$$c= (3.355,4.974)$$ so 
$$|c|= \sqrt{3.355^2+4.974^2}=6$$

Thus, $\boldsymbol{h}(t) = 6t\frac{(3.355,4.974)}{6} = (3.355t,4.974t)$.

So Equation (1) becomes
$$\frac{d \boldsymbol{r}}{dt} = F(t, \boldsymbol{r}) = v_r \frac{(3.355t,4.974t)- \boldsymbol{r}(t)}{|(3.355t,4.974t)- \boldsymbol{r}(t)|}$$

##### SOLUTION:

![Dinosaur Attack Q2 Solution]({{ a11isonliu.github.io}}assets/images/posts/2020/XKCD-dinosaurs/solution.png)

The human is caught by the injured raptor at <code>t = min(timeCaught) = 0.4772386193096548</code>

If the human starts in the center of the triangle and runs at a 56 degree angle above the horizontal, the injured raptor reaches the human first at  ùë°‚âà0.477  seconds.


```
Additional interesting questions to consider: 
Optimize the angle for this problem. 
For which top speed of the wounded raptor does the optimal strategy become to run straight at the wounded raptor?
