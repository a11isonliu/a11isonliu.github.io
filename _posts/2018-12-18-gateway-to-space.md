In Fall 2018, I helped to lead a team of 6 other students to design and build a payload for a high-altitude weather balloon to learn something about the Earth. The large (8m diameter!) balloon was filled with hydrogen and was to go to the edge of the atmosphere (~30km or 100,000 ft above sea level). In addition to studying the flux of cosmic rays throughout the atmosphere using a handheld cosmic ray detector [CosmicWatch](http://www.cosmicwatch.lns.mit.edu/), the final payload also contained a GoPro and detected temperature, pressure, and humidity as the balloon floated to the edge of the atmosphere. We were able to measure the increase of muons, which are byproducts of cosmic rays, over time as the balloon rose and determined peak muon detection to be at approximately 18km above sea level.

From this project I had an incredible experience learning to work with and communicate with a team of my peers successfully and executing an engineering project from design to testing to completion. I got to witness launch, and even be in the lead tracking car chasing the balloon from Eaton, CO to its landing location in somebody's backyard on the plains of Northern Colorado. As part of this class, we also went to Fairview High School (my old school) and did some outreach describing our experiences in Engineering at CU.

**The chase:**

Soon after launch, we immediately got into cars to follow the balloon across the state. I took a navigation training to get the unique experience of being in the lead tracking car with gps locations on the balloon to chase it by car as it was descending. The balloon ended up landing in someone's backyard a little south of Fort Morgan, CO.

**Testing:**

Our payload went through extensive testing to ensure it could withstand flight and near-space environments. Tests included structural (drop, whip, stair) tests, sensor tests, cold tests, and camera tests.

This project was done as a part of ASEN 1400 in Fall 2018. Thanks to my group members Sydney Evans, Nicolena Weber, Tracey Sneed, Joel Bridgeman, Jake Pirnack, Holland Morris, and Prof. Chris Koehler.
