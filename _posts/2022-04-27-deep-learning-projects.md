This is a collection of some natural language processing projects I have done using Pytorch. For many of these projects I have collaborated with Simon Julien and Jackson Curry to create the Jupyter Notebooks. Each folder has an additional README explaining (in detail) the jupyter notebooks and topics that are covered. <!--more-->

These projects were done as part of an Applied Deep Learning course at CU Boulder.
