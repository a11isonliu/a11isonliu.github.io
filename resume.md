## Education
#### University of Colorado, Boulder, CO
**Applied Math B.S., Computer Science Minor, Expected Graduation May 2022**
* **GPA: 3.706/4.000**
* Relevant Coursework: 
	* Computer Science- Data Structures, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence. 
	* Math- Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Numerical Analysis, Fourier Analysis.
* Awards and Honors: Engineering Honors Program, BOLD Scholar, College of Engineering Dean’s List

## Work
#### Kapteyn-Murnane Group, JILA-University of Colorado Boulder
**Student Researcher, June 2017-August 2020**
* Designed and built a commercial-quality M2 laser diagnostic device using MATLAB. I interfaced multiple pieces of scientific equipment and created a graphical user interface to collect and analyze data. The program comprehensively characterized a laser beam by implementing a modified phase-retrieval algorithm.
* Interfaced a novel laser system with an existing chemical engineering experiment.

## Engineering Experience
#### Gateway to Space Class
**Team Leader, August-December 2018**
* Led a team to build and design an experiment for a high-altitude weather balloon. I contributed to the programming, electronics, structural design, testing, and presentation of the engineering project. The experiment consisted of a muon detector and various other sensors connected to an Arduino.
