My name is Allison and I go to school at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am studying Applied Math and am currently a sophomore planning on graduating in May 2022. Outside of school, I am on the Women's Club Ultimate Frisbee team here at CU, I am an avid rock climber, and I love doing physics.
