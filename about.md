My name is Allison Liu. I recently completed a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am interested in using machine learning and data science to solve research problems with applications to space, sustainability, social justice, or healthcare. 

My Master's thesis **"Event Detection in Spatio-Temporal Data Using Singular Value Decompositions"** involved applying data transformations to solar image data to understand patterns in data leading up to large solar flares, which can impact radio and satellite communications. In the past, I have used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce machine learning-ready datasets with the Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center [SWx TREC](https://www.colorado.edu/spaceweather/) at CU and the [Laboratory for Atmospheric Space Physics (LASP)](http://lasp.colorado.edu/). I have also contributed to algorithms at the forefront of ultrafast physics research with the [Kapteyn-Murnane Group](https://jila.colorado.edu/kmlabs/) (see [publications](/publications)).

In parallel with my career interests, I am passionate about machine learning ethics and increasing diversity in STEM. Specifically, I would love to contribute to making machine learning models more interpretable by humans. Furthermore, I am interested in empowering underrepresented students to feel confident in STEM. Over the past three years, I have volunteered regularly with a group of primary school students (largely of underrepresented minorities) to encourage an interest in STEM, developed and taught machine learning curriculum to high schoolers for a week long summer camp, and created and led programming tutorials for undergraduates in a summer research program.

Outside of programming, I love rock climbing, making pottery, and traveling.
