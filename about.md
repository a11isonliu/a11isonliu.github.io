Allison Liu is a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder (expected graduation May 2022). Studying **applied mathematics** and **computer science**, she is interested in using computing tools to solve intractable problems in science and engineering. Excited by the power of artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and numerical analysis, she has been honing her skills in relevant classes using Python, has contributed to algorithms at the forefront of ultrafast physics research with the [Kapteyn-Murnane Group](https://jila.colorado.edu/kmlabs/), and is currently using machine learning techniques to improve solar flare prediction at the [Laboratory for Atmospheric Space Physics (LASP)](http://lasp.colorado.edu/).

Her work has been published in *Science Magazine* and *Proceedings of the Combustion Institute*.

Outside of programming, Allison is passionate about machine learning ethics and increasing diversity in STEM. In parallel with her career interests, she is interested in empowering underrepresented students to feel confident doing STEM. She has volunteered weekly with [PISEC](https://www.colorado.edu/outreach/pisec/), an organization at CU Boulder which empowers grade-school students, largely of under-represented minorities, to become interested in STEM. This past summer (2021), she created and taught machine learning curriculum to motivated high school students for a week-long summer camp.

She is a routesetter at the CU Boulder Climbing Gym and loves rock climbing, hiking, and traveling.
