Allison Liu is a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder (expected graduation May 2022). Studying **applied mathematics** and **computer science**, she is interested in the applications of algorithms to solving every day problems. Fascinated by the power of artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and numerical analysis, she has been honing her skills in relevant classes using Python and contributing to algorithms at the forefront of ultrafast physics research with the [Kapteyn-Murnane Group](https://jila.colorado.edu/kmlabs/).

Her work has been published in *Science Magazine* and *Proceedings of the Combustion Institute*.

>I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy. <cite>Marie Curie</cite>

Outside of programming, Allison volunteers weekly with [PISEC](https://www.colorado.edu/outreach/pisec/), an organization at CU Boulder which empowers grade-school students, largely of under-represented minorities, to become interested in STEM. She is part of the CU Women's Ultimate Frisbee team and loves rock climbing, hiking, and traveling. She is a routesetter at the CU Boulder Climbing gym.
