My name is Allison Liu, and I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics (expected graduation May 2023). I am interested in using machine learning and data science techniques to solve research problems with applications to space, sustainability, social justice, and healthcare. 

Currently, I am working on a project to augment solar magnetogram data using machine learning techniques to improve solar flare prediction with the Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center [SWx TREC](https://www.colorado.edu/spaceweather/) at CU and the [Laboratory for Atmospheric Space Physics (LASP)](http://lasp.colorado.edu/). In the past, I have contributed to algorithms at the forefront of ultrafast physics research with the [Kapteyn-Murnane Group](https://jila.colorado.edu/kmlabs/) (see [publications](/publications)).

In parallel with my career interests, I am passionate about machine learning ethics and increasing diversity in STEM. Specifically, I would love to contribute to making machine learning models more interpretable by humans. Furthermore, I am interested in empowering underrepresented students to feel confident in STEM. Over the past three years, I have volunteered regularly with a group of primary school students (largely of underrepresented minorities) to encourage an interest in STEM, developed and taught machine learning curriculum to high schoolers for a week long summer camp, and created and led programming tutorials for undergraduates in a summer research program.

Outside of programming, I love rock climbing, hiking, and traveling and I am a route setter at the CU Boulder climbing gym!
